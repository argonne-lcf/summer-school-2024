# Programming Novel AI Accelerators for Scientific Computing

Scientific applications are increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to advance science. There are specialized hardware accelerators designed and built to run AI applications efficiently. With a wide diversity in the hardware architectures and software stacks of these systems, it is challenging to understand the differences between these accelerators, their capabilities, programming approaches, and how they perform, particularly for scientific applications. 

In this tutorial, we will cover an overview of the AI accelerators landscape with a focus on SambaNova, Cerebras, Graphcore, Groq, and Nvidia systems along with architectural features and details of their software stacks. We will have hands-on exercises that will help attendees understand how to program these systems by learning how to refactor codes written in standard AI framework implementations and compile and run the models on these systems. The tutorial will enable the attendees with an understanding of the key capabilities of emerging AI accelerators and their performance implications for scientific applications.
